Thanks to the TA for running installation help office hours - hopefully you have been able to get your installation issues resolved!

- A few of you only have everything working up to PySpark. You will need PySpark working for the latter part of the course.

Plan for today:

- Start with poll

- From ETL to Dataflow graphs

- A more realistic example to go through

- (If time) Failures and risks
